attempt 1 dumb 

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:

        profits_list = []

        while len(prices) > 0:
            # get minimum price in given list
            min_price = min(prices)
            # get index of min price
            min_price_index = prices.index(min_price)

            # get max profit from numbers to the right 
            for p in range(min_price_index, len(prices)):
                day_profit = prices[p] - min_price
                profits_list.append(day_profit)
            
            prices.pop(min_price_index)

actual solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:

        # tracking min price and max profit values
        min_price = float('inf')
        max_profit = 0

        # loop through prices
        for p in range(len(prices)):
            # if the current price is smaller than min price, make that the new min price
            if prices[p] < min_price:
                min_price = prices[p]
            # otherwise, subtract min price from the current price 
            # if larger than max profit, assign it as new max profit
            elif prices[p] - min_price > max_profit:
                max_profit = prices[p] - min_price 
        
        return max_profit
```
