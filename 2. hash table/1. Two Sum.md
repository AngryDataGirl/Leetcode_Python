```python
class Solution:
  def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:

    #create dictionary (which is the same as a hash table)
    table = {}

    #loop through list of numbers to store them in the dictionary, where num[i] is the number and i is the index for the number
    #you can't flip them because the same number might show up twice, and you have to go into the dict to look at value to compare
    for i in range(len(nums)):
      table[nums[i]] = i
      
    #loop through the list of numbers again
    for i in range(len(nums)):
      
      #to calculate the complement
      complement = target - nums[i]

      #check if complement in dictionary, and return the index of the complement, and index of original number
      #the AND checks to see if complement index is same as original number index bc you can't use the same number twice
      
      if complement in table and table[complement] != i:
        return [i, table[complement]]
