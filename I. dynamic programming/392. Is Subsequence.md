# 392. Is Subsequence
https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/description/

- technically I did this one as a two pointer not a dynamic programming  question

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        
        i = 0
        j = 0

        # s is always the subsequence 
        
        # a b c
        #     j
        
        # a h b g d c
        #           i 
        if len(s) == 0:
            return True

        while i <= len(t) - 1:
            print(t[i])
            if t[i] == s[j]:
                j += 1
            
            if j > len(s) -1:
                return True

            i += 1

        return False
