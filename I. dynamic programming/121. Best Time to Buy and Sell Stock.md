https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/description/

- dynamic programming "remember the past"
- we are updating the price as we go
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:

        # tracking min price and max profit values
        min_price = float('inf')
        max_profit = 0

        # loop through prices
        for p in range(len(prices)):
            # if the current price is smaller than min price, make that the new min price
            if prices[p] < min_price:
                min_price = prices[p]
            # otherwise, subtract min price from the current price 
            # if larger than max profit, assign it as new max profit
            elif prices[p] - min_price > max_profit:
                max_profit = prices[p] - min_price 
        
        return max_profit
```
