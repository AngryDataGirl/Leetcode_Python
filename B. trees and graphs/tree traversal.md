1. **Inorder Traversal**:
    
    - In this method, we visit the left subtree, then the root node, and finally the right subtree.
    - The algorithm for inorder traversal is as follows:
        1. Recursively traverse the left subtree.
        2. Visit the current node (usually by printing its value).
        3. Recursively traverse the right subtree.
    - Here‚Äôs an example of an inorder traversal function for a binary tree:
    
    Python
    
    ```python
    class Node:
        def __init__(self, value):
            self.left = None
            self.right = None
            self.data = value
    
    def print_inorder(root):
        if root:
            print_inorder(root.left)
            print(root.data, end=" ")
            print_inorder(root.right)
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        root = Node(10)
        root.left = Node(25)
        root.right = Node(30)
        root.left.left = Node(20)
        root.left.right = Node(35)
        root.right.left = Node(15)
        root.right.right = Node(45)
    
        print("Inorder Traversal:", end=" ")
        print_inorder(root)
    ```
    
    AI-generated code. Review and use carefully.¬†.
    
    Output:
    
    ```
    Inorder Traversal: 20 25 35 10 15 30 45
    ```
    
2. **Preorder Traversal**:
    
    - In this method, we visit the root node first, followed by the left subtree, and then the right subtree.
    - The algorithm for preorder traversal is as follows:
        1. Visit the current node.
        2. Recursively traverse the left subtree.
        3. Recursively traverse the right subtree.
    - Preorder traversal is useful for creating a copy of the tree.
3. **Postorder Traversal**:
    
    - In this method, we visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the root node.
    - The algorithm for postorder traversal is as follows:
        1. Recursively traverse the left subtree.
        2. Recursively traverse the right subtree.
        3. Visit the current node (usually by printing its value).
    - Postorder traversal is commonly used for deleting nodes from a tree.

Remember that these traversal techniques are types of depth-first search (DFS) and are essential for understanding and manipulating tree structures in Python. üå≥üêç
