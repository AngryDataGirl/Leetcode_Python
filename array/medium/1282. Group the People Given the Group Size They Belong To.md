# 1282. Group the People Given the Group Size They Belong To
https://leetcode.com/problems/group-the-people-given-the-group-size-they-belong-to/

- nested while loops
- a pointer that does not control the loop
- using group length to control inner loop
- popping results that we've appended
- probably a faster way to do this, will have to think about it
  
```python
class Solution:
    def groupThePeople(self, groupSizes: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        
        # create array
        g = []
        
        # add gropuSizes and person as pairs in the new array 
        for i in range(len(groupSizes)):
            if i not in g:
                g.append([groupSizes[i],i])

        # print(g)
        
        # this is for the final result 
        big_group = []

        # this should be controlled by the len of g, as we will pop the ones that we've assigned to a group
        while len(g) > 0:

            # initialize empty list to append people to
            group = []
            # initialize pointer that will iterate through people 
            pointer = 0

            #select first item groupSize as initiali groupSize to be filled 
            current_group_size_target = g[pointer][0]
            current_group_size_length = len(group)

            # this loop should end when we've filled the current group up to the current group size 
            while current_group_size_length < current_group_size_target:
                # print(g[pointer])

                # if the current groupSize matches the group size target, add it to the group & drop it 
                if g[pointer][0] == current_group_size_target:
                    print("added to group!")
                    group.append(g[pointer][1])

                    # remove the item from g 
                    g.pop(pointer)

                    # check group size to see if we've filled it 
                    current_group_size_length = len(group)
                else:
                    # this pointer needs to exist to ensure we're looping through the entire list
                    pointer += 1 

                # print("current group being filled",group)
            big_group.append(group)
            # print(big_group)
 
        return big_group
