# 1929. Concatenation of Array
https://leetcode.com/problems/concatenation-of-array/

lol this is faster tho

```python
class Solution:
    def getConcatenation(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        return nums * 2
```
Second solution 

1. create empy list of certain length to avoid out of range errors
2. n is the increment to add to the index, based on original list length

```python
class Solution:
    def getConcatenation(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:

        ans = [None] * len(nums)*2
        print(ans)
        n = len(nums)

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            print(nums[i])

            ans[i] = nums[i]
            ans[i + n] = nums[i]
    
        return ans
```
**Considerations:**
You cannot assign to a list like `xs[i] = value`, unless the list already is initialized with at least `i+1` elements. 

Instead, use `xs.append(value)` to add elements to the end of the list. (Though you could use the assignment notation if you were using a dictionary instead of a list.)

**Creating an empty list:**

```python
xs = [None] * 10
 xs
[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]
```

**Assigning a value to an existing element of the above list:**
```python
xs[1] = 5
xs
[None, 5, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]
```
