# Concepts and Learning List

## Data Structure

### arrays (static linear data structure)
Arrays and strings are two of the most fundamental data structures seen in algorithm problems. They're very similar when it comes to solving problems as they're both an ordered collection of elements that can be iterated over. 

### strings
### matrix
### Queue (dynamic linear data structure)
### Stack (dynamic linear data structure)
### Linked list (dynamic linear data structure)


### Tree (non-linear data structure)
### Binary Tree (non-linear data structure)
### Graph (non-linear data structure)  

## Algorithms

### Linear search algorithms 
ie for data sorted linearly (use linear or binary)

### Non Linear search algorithms
ie graph traversal algorithms

## Techniques

### Two Pointer (technique)
- two-pointer:
  - [exhaust both](A1.%20two%20pointer/Two-Pointer%20Examples%20-%20Exhaust%20Both.md) 
  - [opposite ends](A1.%20two%20pointer/Two-Pointer%20Technique%20-%20Opposite%20Ends.md)
- two-pointer techniques:
  - [linked list](A1.%20two%20pointer/Two%20Pointers%20-%20Linked%20List.md)
  - [sliding window](A1.%20two%20pointer/Two%20Pointers%20-%20Sliding%20Window.md)
  - [binary search](A1.%20two%20pointer/Two%20Pointers%20-%20Binary%20Search.md)

### prefix sum (technique)
Prefix sum is a sequence of numbers that represents the sum of all elements up to a specific index in an original sequence of numbers. Prefix sum, also known as cumulative sum, is a data structure technique used in computer science, particularly in algorithms and data structures.

### dynamic programming (technique)


# hash maps
A hash map is a data structure that maps keys to values, allowing for efficient operations like lookup, insertion, and deletion. Hash maps are widely used in various programming applications due to their ability to provide fast access times.
