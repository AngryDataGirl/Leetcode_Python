  - [binary search](A1.%20two%20pointer/Two%20Pointers%20-%20Binary%20Search.md)

### prefix sum (technique)
Prefix sum is a sequence of numbers that represents the sum of all elements up to a specific index in an original sequence of numbers. Prefix sum, also known as cumulative sum, is a data structure technique used in computer science, particularly in algorithms and data structures.

### dynamic programming (technique)
solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems

### bit manipulation

### backtracking
