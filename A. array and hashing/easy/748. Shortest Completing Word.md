# 748. Shortest Completing Word
https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-completing-word/description/

- dictionary counting
- used lambda function to sort list of strings by length
- is alpha to check if letters are letters and not numbers

```python
class Solution:
    def shortestCompletingWord(self, licensePlate: str, words: List[str]) -> str:

        # create the dictionary to check against        
        complete = {}

                if i in complete:
                    complete[i] += 1

                    complete[i] = 1
