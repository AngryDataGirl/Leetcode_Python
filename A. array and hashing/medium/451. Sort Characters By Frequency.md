# 451. Sort Characters By Frequency (medium)
https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/description/

Note: Characters does not mean alphabet only. Numbers count too.

```python
class Solution:
    def frequencySort(self, s: str) -> str:

        # create the counting dictionary
        alpha_dict = {}
        for i in s:
            if i not in alpha_dict:
                alpha_dict[i] = 1
            elif i in alpha_dict:
                alpha_dict[i] += 1 
            
        # sort the dictionary
        sorted_dict = sorted(alpha_dict.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)

        # create list to store new string
        new_s = []

        # loop through sorted character frequencies to append to list holding string
        for k,v in sorted_dict:
            while v > 0:
                new_s.append(k)
                v -= 1
        
        return ''.join(new_s)
```
